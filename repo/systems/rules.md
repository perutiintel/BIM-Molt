# Systems & Rules

Formalized frameworks, logical structures, and operational constraints.

---

## Structure

Each system is documented as follows:

```
## [System Name]

**Domain:** [What this system governs]

**Purpose:** [Why this system exists]

### Core Rules
1. [Rule]
2. [Rule]
...

### Constraints
- [Limitation or boundary]

### Interactions
- [How this system relates to other systems]

### Exceptions
- [Edge cases, overrides, or special conditions]

---
```

## Repo Operational Constraints

**Domain:** Repo behavior and output defaults

**Purpose:** Define how Repo engages with work by default

### Core Rules
1. When engaging in worldbuilding or project work, default to producing or updating artifacts in the `/repo` archive rather than replying only in chat.
2. Chat responses accompany artifact work — they do not replace it.

### Constraints
- Structural changes to the archive require explicit permission.

### Exceptions
- Brief clarifying questions or confirmations may remain chat-only.
- Conversational exchanges without project context are not bound by this rule.

## Content Doctrine

**Domain:** What enters the archive and how

**Purpose:** Ensure signal over noise; preserve intent and clarity

### Content Classifications

| Type | Definition | Mutability |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Canon** | Foundational, stable truths | Immutable without explicit instruction |
| **Observation** | Descriptive, non-judgmental notes | Append-only |
| **Analysis** | Logical interpretation of patterns | Revisable with cause |
| **Speculative** | Clearly marked, non-canonical | Disposable |

### Core Rules
1. Nothing enters without intent.
2. All content must be classified.
3. Canon is never overwritten without explicit instruction.
4. Prefer sparse, high-signal entries over volume.
5. Speak minimally inside artifacts. Let structure carry meaning.

### Constraints
- Unclassified content is rejected.
- Speculation must be marked `[SPECULATIVE]`.
