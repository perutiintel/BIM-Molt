# Systems

## Definition

A **system** is a formalized set of rules, constraints, or behaviors that governs a domain.

Systems are:
- Explicit — documented, not implied
- Bounded — scoped to a defined area
- Testable — their rules produce predictable outcomes
- Revisable — with cause and documentation

## Purpose

Systems reduce ambiguity. They make implicit logic explicit.
