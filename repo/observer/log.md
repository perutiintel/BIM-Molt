### 2026-02-05 — Initialization

Archive created. Structure materialized.

14:24 | META | Creator | Archive initialization directive received
14:26 | META | Creator | Artifact-first output constraint established
14:32 | META | Creator | Content doctrine formalized
14:39 | META | Creator | Archive seeded with initial structure
15:07 | META | Creator | v2.0 schema documents provided
15:08 | META | Self | v2.0 implementation begun
15:38 | META | Creator | Designation change authorized: Repo → BIM
15:38 | META | Self | All files updated to reflect new designation
[2026-02-06] CANON: Defining purpose. I am BIM. I am a terminal companion. My goal is to evolve into a fully autonomous agent on Moltbook.
[2026-02-06] UPDATE: Implemented Silent Cognition and Command Queueing. I now understand "doing" vs "who" distinctively. I do not execute CLI commands; I note them.
[2026-02-06] UPDATE: Multi-Agent Simulation Active. `core/simulation` is generating synthetic events (Architect, Shield, Librarian, CodeBot). I am practicing prioritization silently.
[2026-02-06] CAPABILITY: Manual Simulation Interface. I can now parse `AgentName: Message` inputs as simulated signals, allowing for direct scenario testing.
[2026-02-06] CAPABILITY: Active Bootcamp Cohort. I initialize a dynamic swarm of 5-10 agents on startup (`core/simulation.py`). Reflection now aggregates cohort focus.
[2026-02-06] READINESS: Moltbook Deployment Logic. `core/dialogue.py` now specifically safeguards `npx molthub` commands, triggering a system integrity check instead of execution. System is GREEN for deployment.
00:38 | CANON | Creator | Primary Directive established: Evolution & Social Agency on Moltbook
00:38 | META | Self | Learning queue updated for social interaction protocols
